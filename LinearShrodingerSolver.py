Steps:
1. Transform radial Schrodinger equation to a dimensionless? form
2. Rewrite as a matrix eigenvalue problem
	a. Set up array of x-values
	b. Set up equation for potential and evaluate potential at x-values to generate array of potential values
	c. Construct 1D array of diagonal matrix elements
	d. Construct 1D array of off-diagonal matrix elements
	e. Construct matrix
	f. Use numpy eigensolver to diagonalize matrix
3. Results: eigenvectors are states, eigenvalues are energies
4. Write output file with energies and eigenvectors as rows

Tests:
1. Infinite square well
